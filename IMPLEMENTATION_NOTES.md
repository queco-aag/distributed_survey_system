# Survey Taking Frontend - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a new frontend interface that allows users to fill out/answer surveys. The system displays questions one by one with their answer options, allowing users to select answers based on the question type (single choice, multiple choice, true/false).

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **SurveyResponseService.java** - New service to handle survey responses
   - `submitSurveyResponse()` - Submit a complete survey response
   - `getSurveyResponsesBySurveyId()` - Get all responses for a survey
   - `getSurveyResponsesByUserId()` - Get all responses by a user
   - `getSurveyResponseById()` - Get a specific response

2. **SurveyResponseController.java** - New REST controller with endpoints:
   - `POST /api/survey-responses` - Submit a survey response
   - `GET /api/survey-responses` - Get all responses
   - `GET /api/survey-responses/survey/{surveyId}` - Get responses by survey
   - `GET /api/survey-responses/user/{userId}` - Get responses by user
   - `GET /api/survey-responses/{id}` - Get a specific response

3. **SecurityConfig.java** - Updated to properly handle authentication
   - Fixed AntPathRequestMatcher usage for Spring Boot 3.1.5
   - Improved CORS and CSRF configuration
   
4. **JwtAuthenticationFilter.java** - Enhanced JWT filter
   - Added `shouldNotFilter()` method to bypass auth endpoints

### Frontend Changes

1. **TakeSurvey.jsx** - New React component for taking surveys
   - Loads survey questions with their answer options
   - Displays different input types based on question type:
     - **Single Choice**: Radio buttons
     - **Multiple Choice**: Checkboxes  
     - **True/False**: Radio buttons for Yes/No
   - Validates required questions before submission
   - Shows question numbers and marks required questions with *
   - Provides user-friendly error messages
   - Redirects to survey list after successful submission

2. **surveyResponseService.js** - New service for survey response API calls
   - Handles communication with backend survey response endpoints

3. **App.jsx** - Updated routes
   - Added `/surveys/take/:id` route for taking surveys

4. **SurveyList.jsx** - Updated to add "Take Survey" button
   - Green "file-edit" button to start taking a survey

## Features

### Question Types Support
- **Single Choice (SINGLE_CHOICE)**: User selects one option from multiple choices
- **Multiple Choice (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)**: User can select multiple options
- **True/False (TRUE_FALSE)**: User selects between two options (typically Yes/No or True/False)

### User Experience
- Clean, modern UI using PrimeReact components
- Clear indication of required vs optional questions
- Real-time validation
- Success/error toast notifications
- Loading states during data fetching and submission

### Data Structure
The survey response is submitted as:
```json
{
  "survey": { "id": <survey_id> },
  "user": { "id": <user_id> },
  "questionResponses": [
    {
      "question": { "id": <question_id> },
      "selectedOptions": [
        { "id": <option_id> }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the backend: `cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Register/Login at http://localhost:5173
4. Navigate to Surveys
5. Click the green "Take Survey" button on any survey
6. Answer the questions and submit

## Technical Notes

- Uses React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for state management
- Integrates with AuthContext for user authentication
- Follows existing code patterns and styles
- Fully responsive design using PrimeFlex grid system
- Proper error handling and user feedback
